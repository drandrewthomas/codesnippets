## Geocomputing website code examples


###Introduction

This repository contains the code snippets, complete source files and projects described at www.geocomputing.co.uk. The purpose of the repository is to bring all those files together in one place in the hope they'll be easier to access and of some use to anyone passing through.

The programming languages used in this repository vary a lot, from old Psion 3 OPL code to more modern languages such as Processing, Arduino C and Python. However, mostly it shouldn't be too difficult to port the underlying concepts to other languages.

For bigger code projects please have a look at the other Geocomputing repositories here on GitHub.


###Licensing

Unless otherwise stated in individual projects and files all these codes are licensed under GPL2 as described in the license file here. If a specific project or file does have a different license stated within it then you're free to use that license instead or keep with GPL2.
