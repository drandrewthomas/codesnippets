TRACKER VERSION 1.1 (Updated 10th March 1998)
---------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

Tracker is an investment tracker and analysing tool for the Psion 3a and 3c. It stores details of your stocks and shares, including details of transactions, share histories and present investment value. Any stock or market indicator can be set for display on the grey plane of history graphs, as well as being rebased to show a truer relationship between graphed histories. A wide array of reporting options are provided to allow you to keep permanent records of all aspects of the portfolio. Registered users can import delimited text files as well for updating stock histories and can obtain a copy of the source code for the import/export module by e-mailing me asking for it.

For instructions on how to use Tracker, please see the MANUAL.TXT file.

Tracker is now free to register. See the registration section for more information.

Intallation
-----------

The tracker.zip file includes the following files:

	README.TXT	---> This file
	MANUAL.TXT	---> Users manual
	TRACKER.OPA  	---> Copy to any \APP directory
	TRACKER.PIC	---> Copy to any \APP\TRACKER directory
	TRACKER.LIB	---> Copy to any \APP\TRACKER directory
	TRACKER.IMP	---> Copy to any \APP\TRACKER directory
	SILISOFT.PIC	---> Copy to any \OPD directory

Once the files are copied, hold down the Psion key and press the I key in the system screen and select TRACKER.OPA from whichever drive you installed it to. This will install the TRACKER application and icon to your system screen.

When Tracker is run for the first time, it will create two files, MARKET.TRK and TRACKER.INI in the m:\app\tracker directory. These will be used to store important information and cannot be used from any other drive.
