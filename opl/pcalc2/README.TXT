PIPECALC VERSION 2.0
--------------------

Pipecalc is a program for the Psion 3A which calculates data for pipes of a circular section. It is based on the Colebrooke-White method which is in common use in the United Kingdom. 

Pipecalc can be used to calculate flow in a circular section of known size or to calculate a pipe diameter for a known flow. The program also shows the capacity, spare capacity and self cleansing velocity (which can be changed from the default 0.76m/s) and relationship of surface roughness to 15mm as a simple graphical bar for ease of use. Version 2 can also calculate the flow and pipe diameter for surface water runoff and building drainage. Warnings can also be given for high or low velocities.

Although Pipecalc is supplied as free to use software, I'd appreciate your registering it with me. So, after you've used it a couple of times, please fill out the form in the registration section below and e-mail it to me at amthomas@compuserve.com
