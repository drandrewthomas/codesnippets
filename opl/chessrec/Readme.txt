CHESSREC VERSION
----------------

Introduction
------------

Chessrec is a free utility for recording moves in chess games. You can use it to keep records of the games you, or others, play and is especially useful for people who play postal and e-mail chess. I used it all through the development of the program to store moves in games of e-mail chess I play and found it extremely useful to fill a few spare moments, wherever I am, analysing my position. I hope you'll find it useful as well.

For instructions on how to use Chessrec, please see the MANUAL.TXT file.

Intallation
-----------

The chessrec.zip file includes the following files:

	README.TXT	---> This file
	CHESSREC.OPA  	---> Copy to any \APP directory
	CHESSREC.PIC	---> Copy to any \APP\CHESSREC directory
	PIECES.PIC	---> Copy to any \APP\CHESSREC directory
	SICILIAN.CHS	---> Copy to any \APP\CHESSREC directory

Sicilian.chs is an example chess game and so it is optional whether or not you install it. If you do, deleting it at a future date will have no effect on the program.

Once the files copied, hold down the Psion key and press the I key in the system screen and select CHESSREC.OPA. This will install the CHESSREC application and icon to your system screen.

Chessrec game files should be stored in a '\APP\CHESSREC' directory to ensure they are shown in the file list under the system screen icon.
